# TO-DO app with Seach.

A TO-DO application with Search functionality 

# Getting Started

To develop the application locally, follow the following steps:

1.Install all dependencies.

Open your command-line interface (such as Terminal or Command Prompt.
Navigate to the root directory of your React app.
Run the following command to initialize a new package.json file if you haven't already done so:

```bash
   npm init -y
```


2.Start a MongoDB database server and acquire the connection string.

You can use MongoDB Atlas or start a local instance via a local installation of MongoDB. Make sure to whitelist your IP address while using Atlas.

3.Create a .env file in the back-end and add your MongoDB server connection string to it.

# Inside /KoderTroop-backend

`REPO Link`= https://github.com/Yash0922/KoderTroop-backend

`Use This backend Deploy link`= https://cautious-pinafore-wasp.cyclic.app/


`Use for POST data`=https://travelopia-backend.vercel.app/tasks/


`Use for GET data`=https://travelopia-backend.vercel.app/tasks/

Use for Search data`=https://travelopia-backend.vercel.app/tasks/search?query=${searchParameter}

```bash
 `MONGO_URL`=mongodb+srv://name:password@cluster0.ss532hp.mongodb.net/todo?appName=mongosh+1.8.0
```
4.start the back-end development server.


# Inside /take-home-test

5.Apply your back-end server to travelopia-frontend

Inside `.env` create this:

```bash
  REACT_APP_SERVER_URL= http://localhost:8080
```




Now your frontend is connected with backend

# Inside /my-todo-application

```bash
